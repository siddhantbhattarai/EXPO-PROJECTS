## Password Strength Evaluation

The password strength is evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Length:** Passwords shorter than 8 characters are automatically weak.
2. **Complexity:** 
   - Includes lowercase letters.
   - Includes uppercase letters.
   - Includes numbers.
   - Includes special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).
3. **Common Passwords:** Checks against a database of weak and common passwords.
4. **Pattern Detection:** Identifies keyboard patterns, repeated sequences, or predictable combinations.
5. **Entropy Calculation:** Estimates password entropy to evaluate its strength mathematically.
6. **Estimated Crack Time:** Predicts the time required to brute-force the password.
